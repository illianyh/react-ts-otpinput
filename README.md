# OTP input (React & Typescript)
There are tons of OTP (one-time password) or OTC (one-time code) inputs I have seen out there, but most of them are difficult to use or doesn't give me a great user experience. In this project, I tried my best to handle some of the issues that I can see when interacting with OTP inputs.

## Features
- Pasting value that has the same length as the OTP inputs
- Using arrow keys: up, down, right and left
- Changing a single input value without interrupting the placement of other input values

## Quick Start
1. Clone the app:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:illianyh/react-ts-otpinput.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd react-ts-otpinput
yarn install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
yarn start
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
